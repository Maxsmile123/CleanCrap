## Description
The CleanCrap project will allow you to remove an object from the video in a couple of clicks.   
To do this, you do not need to understand complex Adobe programs.

## Work in Progress
- [x] Come up with a design
- [x] Make a landing page
- [x] Adapt the neural network to all video sizes
- [x] Register domain
- [ ] Upload a neural network to the cloud (Google Colab)

## Further improvements
- [ ] Create an editor to highlight the mask
- [ ] Transfer calculations to GPU
- [ ] Improve the speed of passing a sliding window in a neural network
- [ ] Fix the blurring of objects
- [ ] Learn how to remove shadows from objects

## How to use it?
Run `setup.py` then run `streamlit run app.py`. Make sure that you have all the dependencies from the file installed `requirements.txt`
## Our advantages

## Authors
This project was completed by the ASSS.

## Note
The project does not use its own neural network technologies.   
We used a ready-made neural network of our [comrades](https://github.com/MCG-NKU/E2FGVI), who allowed us to use it for non-commercial projects.
